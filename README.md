This repository contains a collection of small Python projects that can be integrated into larger projects. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including data manipulation, web scraping, machine learning, and more. 

## Basic Programming Concepts

Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. The repository covers the following basic programming concepts in Python:

- **Variables**: Assigning values to variables, data types, and variable scope.
- **Control Structures**: Conditional statements (if/else), loops (for/while), and exception handling (try/except).
- **Functions**: Defining functions, passing arguments, and returning values.
- **Classes and Objects**: Creating classes, defining methods, and instantiating objects.
- **Modules and Packages**: Importing modules and packages, creating and distributing packages.

## Popular Libraries

Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries that can be used for various purposes. The repository includes examples of projects that use the following popular libraries:

- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computing that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis that provides data structures for efficiently storing and manipulating large datasets.
- **Requests**: A library for sending HTTP requests and working with APIs.
- **BeautifulSoup**: A library for web scraping that provides tools for parsing HTML and XML documents.
- **Scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning that provides tools for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
- **Pygame**: A library for game development that provides tools for creating 2D games.
- **Django**: A web framework for building web applications using Python.

## Setting up Python
